        <h1>Apple Watch Series 6</h1>
        <h6> with ability to measure blood oxygen levels</h6>
        <p>
          The Apple Watch Series 6 is the sixth-generation model of the Apple Watch. It was announced on
          September 15, 2020 during an Apple Special Event alongside the Apple Watch SE, and began shipping to
          the public on September 18. Its principal improvement over its predecessors is the inclusion of a
          sensor to monitor blood oxygen saturation. Hermès, Nike+, and Edition models of the watch are
          available.

        <p>
          The Series 6 also comes with the new S6 processor, which promises up to 20 percent faster
          performance. It’s based on Apple’s in-house A13 chip and brings the first major update to the Apple
          Watch’s performance since the Series 4, given that last year’s Series 5 model used the same S4 CPU
          rebranded as the S5 with other additions like a compass and a new display controller

          <p class="lead mb-0">The Apple Watch’s battery life has concerned many prospective customers, as Apple said
            only that the Watch will need to be charged nightly. Earlier this year, we reported that
            Apple’s development targets for Apple Watch battery life were 2.5-4 hours for heavy app
            usage, versus 19 hours per day of combined usage between light app access,
            notifications, and Glances.

                <p> Apple Watch is good, but better suited on the wrists of early adopters and

                  Originally, I was disappointed with the high prices of these watches. I didn't want to drop
                  $700 on a watch when I wasn't sure I would even use a watch. However, I ended up being very
                  happy with them, and I'm convinced it's what I would have chosen even if my funds allowed me
                  other choices - at least, that's what I tell myself. </p>
